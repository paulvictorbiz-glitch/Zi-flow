# Ziflow — Change Log

Rollback log for edits made by Claude. Each entry captures the OLD version of
the affected snippets before they were replaced, so a change can be reverted
by hand if needed. Newest entries on top.

Workflow per change:
1. Log the old snippet here before editing.
2. Build the task.
3. Verify it works (syntax check, smoke test, dev server, etc.).
4. Ask the user to confirm before treating the change as committed.

## 2026-05-15 — Refactor step 4: hoist pipeline-board constants into shared-data

**Duplications found:** only `pipeline.jsx` was carrying local constants
that shadowed shared-data (other pages already import from there).

- `PIPELINE_STAGES` was a hand-maintained array of `{key, label}` —
  shadowed `STAGES` (already in shared-data) and `STAGE_LABEL` (also
  there, with title-case labels vs the board's upper-case style).
  Now derived inline from those two: `STAGES.map(k => ({key: k,
  label: STAGE_LABEL[k].toUpperCase()}))`. One label table, one
  ordering source.

- `LANES` was 4 hardcoded lanes with names + roles. Moved to
  `shared-data.jsx` as `PIPELINE_LANES`, with names sourced from
  `PEOPLE` so a rename in one place propagates everywhere. The
  "review" lane id is preserved (it's a workflow slot, not a person
  id — Leroy's PEOPLE id is "maya").

Verified by build: 95 modules unchanged, CSS byte-identical, JS bundle
~70 bytes smaller from the dedup.

## 2026-05-15 — Refactor step 3: extract modals from fab.jsx

**Before:** `src/components/fab.jsx` was 345 lines mixing:
- `CreateFab` (the floating button, the only externally-used symbol)
- `TaskModal` (~60 lines)
- `ReelModal` (~150 lines, including its own `nextReelId` helper)
- `Modal` / `Field` / `SegRow` / `SelectInput` (shared form primitives)

External imports of the file:
```
src/app.jsx: import { CreateFab } from "./components/fab.jsx"
```
Only `CreateFab` was actually used outside — the other exports were leakage.

**After:**

```
src/components/fab.jsx                  (50 lines — just CreateFab)
src/components/modals/Modal.jsx         (Modal + Field + SegRow + SelectInput)
src/components/modals/TaskModal.jsx
src/components/modals/ReelModal.jsx     (includes nextReelId helper)
```

`fab.jsx` now imports the two flow modals from `./modals/`. Verified by
build (`npm run build`): 95 modules transformed (was 92 → +3 new files),
CSS byte-identical, JS bundle 461.01 kB (same as before).

## 2026-05-15 — Refactor step 2: folder structure (flat → src/pages, components, store, lib)

**Goal:** end the 25-flat-files-at-project-root situation. Pure mechanical move; no behavior change.

**New layout:**

```
src/
  main.jsx              (was: ./main.jsx)
  app.jsx               (was: ./app.jsx)
  auth.jsx              (was: ./auth.jsx)
  pages/
    pipeline.jsx, my-work.jsx, detail.jsx, detail-data.jsx,
    footage-library.jsx, export-view.jsx, analytics.jsx,
    list-view.jsx, calendar-view.jsx, archived-view.jsx
  components/
    fab.jsx, components.jsx, notifications.jsx, variant-row.jsx,
    rm-node.jsx, handoff.jsx, AttachedFootageList.jsx,
    FootageBrainSearch.jsx
  store/
    store.jsx
  lib/
    supabase-client.js, footage-brain-client.js,
    shared-data.jsx, time.jsx
```

**Files unchanged in place:** `index.html` (Vite entry), `package.json`,
`vite.config.js`, `seed/`, `supabase/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`,
`SMOKE.md`, `CHANGES.md`, `start-all.bat`.

**Index entry:** `index.html` script src updated from `/main.jsx` to
`/src/main.jsx`.

**Import path rewrites:** every relative import inside the moved files was
rewritten to match the new locations (e.g. `./store.jsx` →
`../store/store.jsx` when called from a page, etc.). Done in bulk via a
Python script after `git mv` to preserve history.


**A. Preview button error.**

Old (`FootageBrainSearch.jsx` lines 300-304):

```jsx
window.open(
  "http://localhost:5173/files/" + result.video_file_id,
  "_blank",
  "noopener,noreferrer"
);
```

Port 5173 was the Vite dev port. Footage Brain in production serves both
backend and frontend from `localhost:8765`, so the preview link 404'd.
Switched to 8765.

**B. Music + Inspiration link buttons (post-create editable).**

Old behaviour (`detail.jsx` lines 185-218): the audio/inspiration URLs
saved during reel creation only rendered as links when present. There was
no way to add one after the reel was created.

New behaviour: two always-visible pills in the reel detail header
(alongside "Current reel state"). When empty they read `+ Music` /
`+ Inspiration` and clicking prompts for a URL. When set they read
`♪ Music ↗` / `✦ Inspiration ↗` in amber — clicking opens the link,
right-click/dropdown lets you edit. No more orphan links after create.


**Goal:** surface the new backend search modes (`visual` = CLIP frame
embeddings, `caption` = VLM captions, `multimodal` = fused) in the reel-card
"Search Footage Brain" modal so editors can pick them alongside the existing
semantic / keyword / hybrid / filename modes.

**File:** `FootageBrainSearch.jsx`

**Old snippet — SEARCH_MODES (lines 16–21):**

```jsx
const SEARCH_MODES = [
  { key: "semantic", label: "Semantic", hint: "meaning + visual concepts" },
  { key: "keyword",  label: "Keyword",  hint: "exact transcript terms" },
  { key: "hybrid",   label: "Hybrid",   hint: "semantic + keyword" },
  { key: "filename", label: "Filename", hint: "match by file name" },
];
```

**Old snippet — input placeholder branch (lines 214–220):**

```jsx
placeholder={
  mode === "filename"
    ? "e.g., '20241223', 'IMG_0512', 'drone'"
    : mode === "keyword"
    ? "Exact word in transcript…"
    : "e.g., 'sunrise drone shot', 'people talking indoors'"
}
```

**Note:** `footage-brain-client.js` already forwards `mode` verbatim to the
`/api/search` endpoint, so no client-side change is needed — the backend
(`backend/app/search/engine.py` in footage-brain-test) already routes
`visual`, `caption`, `multimodal` to the right handlers.
